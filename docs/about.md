# About Pleiades

Pleiades is the name of IEETA's High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster.
In this page, you will learn about its purpose, capabilities, and the unique opportunities it offers for research and computation-intensive projects.

## Objectives

- **Support advanced research:** The primary objective of Pleiades is to enable and accelerate research that requires substantial computational resources.
- **Offer an open and unified computation platform:** By aggregating heterogenous computation devices under the same cluster, we can facilitate in a unified way fair access to all of our reshearchers.
- **Rely on proven open technologies:** By using open-source, widely accepted technologies, such as SLURM,
  we hope to ensure system longevity and vendor-independence, as well as provide valuable skills to our users.

## Capabilities

Pleiades offers a range of computing resources, including traditional CPU and GPU-enabled nodes. 

## Why this name

In the real-world, [Pleiades is a star cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiades)
located within the constellation of Taurus.
A collective noun seemed appropriate to describe the plural, heterogeneous nature of a computing cluster,
and Pleiades is both a beatiful word and a brilliant object!
