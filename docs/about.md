# About IEETA HPC

This page is dedicated to providing you with a comprehensive understanding of the IEETA HPC facility, its purpose, capabilities, and the unique opportunities it offers for research and computation-intensive projects. 

## Objectives

- **Support Advanced Research:** The primary objective of IEETA HPC is to enable and accelerate research that requires substantial computational resources.
- **Offer an open and unified computation platform:** By aggregating heterogenous computation devices under the same cluster, we can facilitate in a unified way and fair access to all of our reshearchers.

## Capabilities

IEETA HPC offers a range of computing resources, including traditional CPU clusters and GPU-enabled nodes for deep learning tasks. 

## Cluster Configuration

The IEETA HPC facility features a robust hardware configuration, including:

- **Compute Nodes:** TODO
- **GPU Nodes:** TODO
- **Storage:** TODO

For managing its access we mainly rely on [slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html) 

## Support Team

Currently the IEETA HPC is responsability of the "Pelouro de Infraestrutra" team:

- Jo√£o Rodrigues (jmr@ua.pt)
- Eurico Pedrosa (efp@live.ua.pt)
- Tiago Almeida (tiagomeloalmeida@ua.pt)
