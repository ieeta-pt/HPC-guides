In this page, you will learn about its purpose, capabilities, and the unique opportunities it offers for research and computation-intensive projects. Objectives Support advanced research: The primary objective of Pleiades is to enable and accelerate research that requires substantial computational resources. Offer an open and unified computation platform: By aggregating heterogenous computation devices under the same cluster, we can facilitate in a unified way fair access to all of our reshearchers. Rely on proven open technologies: By using open-source, widely accepted technologies, such as SLURM, we hope to ensure system longevity and vendor-independence, as well as provide valuable skills to our users. Capabilities Pleiades offers a range of computing resources, including traditional CPU and GPU-enabled nodes. Why this name In the real-world, Pleiades is a star cluster located within the constellation of Taurus. A collective noun seemed appropriate to describe the plural, heterogeneous nature of a computing cluster, and Pleiades is both a beatiful word and a brilliant object!

Access IEETA cluster (Pleiades) Access the cluster via SSH using the credentials provided to you by email. If you do not have access yet, please refer to the How to Access page. $ ssh user@pleiades.ieeta.pt By default, upon logging in, you will land on our login node in your home directory, which is located at /data/home . This is a network storage partition visible to all cluster nodes. The login node is where you should prepare your code in order to submit jobs to run on the worker nodes of the cluster. The worker nodes are equipped with powerful resources. Currently, we have: CPU nodes : Nodes with a high amount of RAM and faster CPUs. GPU nodes : Nodes equipped with GPUs and more modest CPU/RAM configurations. For more information about each node check the nodes page . 2. Prepare your software environment The next step is to prepare your environment to run/build your application. We recommend using a virtual environment so that you can install any package locally. First, load the Python module. $ module load python Then create and activate your virtual environment. $ python -m venv virtual-venv $ source virtual-venv/bin/activate You can then install your package dependencies with pip. (virtual-venv)$ pip install --upgrade pip (virtual-venv)$ pip install torch transformers 3. Create your SLURM job script After setting up your runtime environment, you should create a SLURM job script to submit your job. For example: #!/bin/bash #SBATCH --job-name=trainer # create a short name for your job #SBATCH --output=\"trainer-%j.out\" # %j will be replaced by the slurm jobID #SBATCH --nodes=1 # node count #SBATCH --ntasks=1 # total number of tasks across all nodes #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=2 # cpu-cores per task (>1 if multi-threaded tasks) #SBATCH --gres=gpu:1 # number of gpus per node #SBATCH --mem=4G # Total amount of RAM requested #SBATCH --partition=gpu # The queue where to submit the job source /virtual-venv/bin/activate # If you have your venv activated when you submit the job, then you do not need to activate/deactivate python your_trainer_script.py deactivate The script is made of two parts: 1. Specification of the resources needed and some job information; 2. Comands that will be executed on the destination node. As an example, in the first part of the script, we define the job name, the output file and the requested resources (1 GPU, 2 CPUs and 4GB RAM). Then, in the second part, we define the tasks of the job. Note that the cluster is configured to use the CPU partition by default. Therefore, when requesting GPU resources, you must explicitly specify the GPU partition using --partition=gpu. To view available partitions and nodes, use: $ sinfo For a more detailed view of all system resources, use: $ cluster-info 4. Submit the job To submit the job, you should run the following command: $ sbatch script_trainer.sh Submitted batch job 144 You can check the job status using the following command: $ squeue","title":"Quick Start"},{"location":"quick_start/#quick-start","text":"In this page you can find a quick start guide on how to use IEETA cluster (Pleiades).","title":"Quick start"},{"location":"quick_start/#1-access-ieeta-cluster-pleiades","text":"Access the cluster via SSH using the credentials provided to you by email.
